# OOP

Owner: Hasibul Huda

Object oriented programming or OOP for short is an popular programming language paradigm. It has the concept of `classes` and `objects`. Popular OOP based languages include Java, C++, Ruby

## Classes

Classes are blueprints. They define how an object should look like, what it should hold and possibly do. Classes often represents a broad category like Animals, Color or Language.

Classes contain properties. They are known as attributes. A Class can also contain method that works with those properties.

> **A Car class may have attribute such as model and method, repaint etc.**
> 

Every object created from a particular class will have access to these attributes and methods. But the state of the attributes will vary object to object.

## Objects

Objects are instances of a Class. An Object has all the methods and attribute of the Class it’s instanced from.

> A Car Class may have hundreds of instances of it. So there maybe hundreds of objects created from Car Class. Each will have all the attributes and methods of the Car Class but the values will be different based on the Car object itself.
